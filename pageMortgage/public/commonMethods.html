        <h1>Common Methods of Holding Title</h1>
        <h2>Sole Ownership</h2> <br>

        <p>Sole ownership may be described as ownership by an individual or other entity capable of acquiring title.  Examples of common vesting cases of sole ownership are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas">A Single Man or Woman, an Unmarried Man or Woman or a Widow or Widower:</p>  
                 
                <p>A man or woman who is not legally married or in a domestic partnership.  For example:  John Buyer, a single man.</p>

            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p  class="negritas">A Married Man or Woman as His or Her Sole and Separate Property: </p>
                 
                <p>A married man or woman who wishes to acquire title in his or her name alone.</p>
                <p>
                    The title company insuring title will require the spouse of the married man 
                    or woman acquiring title to specifically disclaim or relinquish his or her right, 
                    title and interest to the property.  This establishes that both spouses want title 
                    to the property to be granted to one spouse as that spouse’s sole and separate property. 
                     The same rules will apply for same sex married couples. 
                     For example:  John Buyer, a married man, as his sole and separate property.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas"> A Domestic Partner as His or Her Sole and Separate Property:</p> 
                 
                <p>A domestic partner who wishes to acquire title in his or her name alone.</p>
                <p>
                    The title company insuring title will require the domestic partner
                     of the person acquiring title to specifically disclaim or relinquish 
                     his or her right, title and interest to the property.  This establishes 
                     that both domestic partners want title to the property to be granted to
                      one partner as that person’s sole and separate property. For example:  John Buyer,
                     a registered domestic partner, as his sole and separate property.
                </p>

            </li>

        <h1>CO-OWNERSHIP</h1>
        <h2>Title to property owned by two or more persons may be vested in the following forms:</h2>

  
        <ol>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas">Community Property:</p>
                 
                <p>A form of vesting title to property owned together by married persons or by domestic partners. 
                     Community property is distinguished from separate property, which is property 
                     acquired before marriage or before a domestic partnership by separate gift 
                     or bequest, after legal separation, 
                    or which is agreed in writing to be owned by one spouse or domestic partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In California, real property conveyed
                    to a married person, or to a domestic partner is presumed 
                    to be community property, unless otherwise stated (i.e. property acquired as separate property
                    by gift, bequest or agreement).  Since all such property is owned equally, both parties 
                    must sign all agreements and documents transferring the property or using it as
                    security for a loan.  Each owner has the right to dispose of his/her one half of
                    the community property by will.  For example:  Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, 
                    husband and wife, as community property, or Sally Smith and Jane Smith, registered domestic partners  as community property.  
                    Another example for same sex couples:  Sally Smith and Jane Smith, spouses, as community property. 
                </p>

            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p  class="negritas"> Community Property with Right of Survivorship:</p> 
                 
                <p>A form of vesting title to property owned together by spouses or by domestic partners. 
                     This form of holding title shares many of the characteristics of community property 
                     but adds the benefit of the right of survivorship similar to title held in joint tenancy.  
                     There may be tax benefits for holding title in this manner.  On the death of an owner, the decedent’s 
                     interest ends and the survivor owns all interests in the property.  For example:  
                     Bruce Buyer and Barbara Buyer, husband and wife, as community property with right of survivorship,
                      or John Buyer and Bill Buyer, spouses,  as community property with right of survivorship.  
                      Another example for same sex couples:  Sally Smith and Jane Smith, registered domestic partners,
                       as community property with right of survivorship.

                </p>
           
            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas">Joint Tenancy:</p> 
                 
                <p>A form of vesting title to property owned by two or more persons,
                     who may or may not be married or domestic partners, in equal interests, 
                     subject to the right of survivorship in the surviving joint tenant(s).  
                     Title must have been acquired at the same time, by the same conveyance, 
                     and the document must expressly declare the intention to create a joint tenancy estate.  
                     When a joint tenant dies, title to the property is automatically conveyed 
                     by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant(s).  
                     Therefore, joint tenancy property is not subject to disposition by will.  
                     For example:  Bruce Buyer, a married man and George Buyer, a single man, as joint tenants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note:  If a married person enters into a joint tenancy that does not include their spouse, 
                    the title company insuring title may require the spouse of the married man or woman acquiring
                     title to specifically consent to the joint tenancy. 
                     The same rules will apply for same sex married couples and domestic partners.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas">Tenancy in Common:</p> 
                 
                <p>
                    A form of vesting title to property owned by any two or more individuals in undivided fractional interests. 
                     These fractional interests may be unequal in quantity or duration and may arise at different times. 
                     Each tenant in common owns a share of the property, is entitled to a comparable portion of 
                     the income from the property and must bear an equivalent share of expenses.  
                     Each co-tenant may sell, lease or will to his/her heir that share of the property belonging to him/her. 
                      For example: Bruce Buyer, a single man, as to an undivided 3/4 interest and Penny Purchaser, 
                    a single woman, as to an undivided 1/4 interest.

                    A corporation is a legal entity, created under state law, consisting of one or more shareholders 
                    but regarded under law as having an existence and personality separate from such shareholders.
                </p>

                <p>A partnership is an association of two or more persons who can carry on business for profit as co-owners, as governed by the Uniform Partnership Act. 
                     A partnership may hold title to real property in the name of the partnership.
                </p>
           
            </li>
            <li class=" listOl"> <p class="negritas">Trustees of a Trust*:</p> 
                 
                <p>A Trust is an arrangement whereby legal title to property is transferred by a grantor to a person called a trustee, 
                    to be held and managed by that person for the benefit of the people specified in the trust agreement, called the beneficiaries. 
                     A trust is generally not an entity that can hold title in its own name.  
                    Instead title is often vested in the trustee of the trust.  For example:  Bruce Buyer trustee of the Buyer Family Trust.

                <p>
                    This form of ownership is a legal entity and is similar to both the corporation and the partnership.  
                    The operating agreement will determine how the LLC functions and is taxed.  Like the corporation its existence is separate from its owners.
