          We also specialize in the <a href="" style="color: red;">Home Affordable Refinance Program</a>  (HARP), 
          which allows homeowners dealing with significant property devaluation on homes purchased before May 31st,
           2009 to explore their refinancing options. If you meet one or more of these initial requirements,
            and your home is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you may be eligible for this program. 
            Qualified homeowners will have the opportunity to lower their mortgage payments and refinance based on current low interest 
            rates without the need of an appraisal.
